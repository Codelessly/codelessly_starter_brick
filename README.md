## Updating this brick

First of all, enable flutter and get dependencies inside the
__brick__ directory by running:

```bash
cd __brick
```

Next get flutter dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Make any changes you like, and once you're satisfied and want
to publish your changes to this brick, run:

```bash
flutter build web --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=true
```

To regenerate the build folder output so that CI/CD services like
Netlify and Vercel can reference a pre-built and updated /build/ folder
directly without needing to build from scratch.

After that, clean up the __brick__ directory by removing these 
excluded directories and files:
- .dart_tool
- .metadata
- pubspec.lock
- .flutter-plugins
- .flutter-plugins-dependencies

If you don't delete the .dart_tool folder, mason brick creation
will take upwards of 400 seconds.
